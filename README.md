# Overview

This is a sample R script that contains a function for plotting the somatic mutation
signature landscape.

To use the code, it is necessary to generate a column called "Somatic_mutation_type" 
which contains information of the observed somatic mutation as well as the neighbouring
nucleotide context in the format of "A[A>G]C"
